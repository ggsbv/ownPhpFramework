# Simple PHP framework from scratch

## Functionality

The user can submit names to the server. The names are stored on a local
mysql database. User can view all entered names on the /users uri.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create own MVC style framework from scratch,
in order to have better understanding before moving on to Laravel. Having gone
through this, I hope to have a more intimate understanding about what Laravel
is doing behind the scenes.

The project served as an introduction to the Model-Views-Controller design pattern,
as well as an introduction to PHP in general.
